<h1>What Do You Mean &quot;Plus&quot;?</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>
The 'compiler' for LSL Plus accepts the basic LSL scripting language code, <em>plus</em> some
additional extensions.  That may sound a bit strange, since unless the LSL compiler within SL does
not accept those extensions, what use could they be?  What the LSL Plus compiler does is take as
input LSL Plus code, and it produces 'straight' LSL code as a compiled output.  If you feed it
plain LSL code, it will simply produce equivalent LSL code as its output (in addition to validating
that it is syntactically correct, and allowing you to test it).  But LSL Plus also allows you to 
separate you code into <em>scripts</em> and <em>modules</em>.  If you have some useful functions that
you use over and over again in different LSL scripts, you have to continually cut and paste them into
each script that you write (and then, assuming you are editing offline, paste the whole thing into 
the SL LSL editor).  With LSL Plus, you can separate these reusable functions (and global variables)
into modules, and <em>import</em> these modules into your scripts (and into other modules).  When
the scripts are compiled, the resulting plain LSL script can then be uploaded (cut-n-pasted) into
SL.
</p>

<p>At this point some clever and/or skeptical reader might be mumbling something like
 &quot;Couldn't you just use the C preprocessor instead, and use the #include directive?&quot;  The answer
is, yeah, probably, but a &quot;language aware&quot; import mechanism is potentially more powerful
than source pre-processing.  Also, I didn't think of that until after I'd gotten it working.
The import mechanism, though, is pretty useful; it allows the symbols you import to be qualified with
a prefix, so that you can avoid namespace problems, for example.  It allows parameterization of the 
import, right now just allowing the binding of <em>free variables</em> that the module declares to
variables within the scope of the script.  I envision extending this to providing functions and types
as import parameters as well, which will allow creation of generic modules, such as a generic sort 
module.  But if you just want to use LSL Plus to edit and test &quot;straight&quot; LSL code, the 
<em>plus</em> features won't get in your way.</p>

<p>
Here is a basic example of module usage:</p>

<p>Module: avogadro.lslm</p>
<pre>
$module ()

float avogadro = 6.022142E+23;

float to_moles(float molecules) {
    return molecules / avogadro;
}
</pre>

<p>Script: really_useful.lslp</p>

<pre>
$import avogadro.lslm () my_;

default {
    state_entry() {
        llSay(0, "Avogadro's number is: " + (string)my_avogadro);
        llSay(0, "5 billion molecules is: " + ((string)my_to_moles(5000000000.0)) + " moles");
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, the inclusion of the prefix &quot;my_&quot; is not necessary.  You could
omit it on the first line, in the import statement, and remove it from references to the avogadro
constant and the to_moles function.  But if you happen to have other avogadro's number definitions
and mole conversion functions scattered around in your script already (and, let's face it, who
doesn't?) then this feature will prevent name clashes.</p>

<p>Since LSL Plus 0.3.1, the module feature has been enhanced.  The basic module system generally works
like an include mechanism, with some rewriting of terms.  The above 'avogadro' example will produce
a final 'compiled' LSL script that looks like:
</div>
<pre>
// LSL script generated: Wed May 21 20:22:17 Eastern Daylight Time 2008
float my_avogadro = 6.0221424e23;
float my_to_moles(float molecules){
    return (molecules / my_avogadro);
}
default {
    state_entry() {
        llSay(0,("Avogadro's number is: " + ((string)my_avogadro)));
        llSay(0,(("5 billion molecules is: " + ((string)my_to_moles(7.050327e8))) + " moles"));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Each 'import' gets expanded 'inline', with rewriting, to produce the final output.  But in some 
circumstances, this results in much-less than optimal code (code that uses up too much memory).  Consider
the following system of modules:</p>

<p>Module 'debug.lslm':</p>
<pre>
$module (integer DEBUG)

debug(string msg) {
    if (DEBUG) llOwnerSay(msg);
}
</pre>

<p>Module 'sum.lslm':</p>
<pre>
$module (integer dbg)

$import debug.lslm(DEBUG=dbg);

float compute_sum(float x, float y) {
    debug("computing sum of " + ((string) x) + " and " + ((string) y));
    return x + y;
}
</pre>

<p>Module 'product.lslm'</p>
<pre>
$module (integer DEBUG)

$import debug.lslm(DEBUG=DEBUG);

float compute_product(float x, float y) {
    debug("computing product of " + ((string) x) + " and " + ((string) y));
    return x * y;
}
</pre>

<p>And a script that uses the modules</p>
<pre>

integer debug_flag = FALSE;

$import sum.lslm(dbg=debug_flag);
$import product.lslm(DEBUG=debug_flag);

default {
    state_entry() {
        llOwnerSay((string)compute_sum(3.0,compute_product(5.0,PI)));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
If simple rewriting is used, this script won't compile, since both 'sum.lslm' and 'product.lslm'
import, and therefore define, their own instances of 'debug.lslm'.  One or the other could be given
a prefix (e.g. 'my_'), but that would result in a redundant definition of the debug function (e.g.
'debug' and 'my_debug').  To avoid this issue, the compiler will detect that the same module is being
imported with the same parameters (in this case, the same top-level 'debug_flag' is passed through
the each intermediate module, to the 'debug.lslm' module), and recognize that only one 'shared' 
instance of the module needs to be included in the compiled output, thus resolving the name conflict
and eliminating redundant code.  The output looks like:</p>

<pre>
// LSL script generated: Wed May 21 21:23:56 Eastern Daylight Time 2008
integer debug_flag = FALSE;
float compute_product(float x,float y){
    debug(((("computing product of " + ((string)x)) + " and ") + ((string)y)));
    return (x * y);
}
float compute_sum(float x,float y){
    debug(((("computing sum of " + ((string)x)) + " and ") + ((string)y)));
    return (x + y);
}
debug(string msg){
    if (debug_flag) llOwnerSay(msg);
}
default {
    state_entry() {
        llOwnerSay(((string)compute_sum(3.0,compute_product(5.0,PI))));
    }
}
</pre> 

<p>Rewriting versus sharing in a particular instance may be confusing.  If the same module
is imported in two different places, but the arguments passed when importing
the module don't resolve to exactly the same global variables, then the instances can't be shared,
and the only way the script will be able to be compiled is if a prefix is used somewhere to 
give the imported symbols different names.</p>
