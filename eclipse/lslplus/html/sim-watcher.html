<h1>Sim Watcher View</h1>

<p>The Sim Watcher view allows you to monitor the progress of your LSL simulation (not an LSL Unit Test, which
uses the JUnit-like test view).  The Sim Watcher view appears when you launch a script directly, or (more
usefully) you define and then launch a <a href="sim-project.html">sim project</a>.  The view will look 
something like:</p>

<img src="images/sim-watcher.jpg"/>

<p>The view has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>log</strong> which shows various things that have happened in the simulation, in 
reverse chronological order (most recent events at the top).</li>
<li>The simulation time display, which shows the amount of 'simulated' time that has passed since the
start of the simulation.  Note that simulated time passes at a different rate than 'real' time (often much
faster).</li>
<li>A dropdown list and associated 'go' button to allow you to select and send an arbitrary LSL event to
an arbitrary script, prim, or object.  A popup will appear to allow you to enter parameters appropriate
to the event.  Note that proper event semantics aren't guaranteed.  E.g. you could send a timer event to
any script, even if that script had never registered a timer.</li>
<li>The chat button, which allows you to 'chat' as any of the avatars that are present in the simulation.
A popup will appear prompting you for the avatar to chat as, the actual text you want to chat, and the
channel to chat on.</li>
<li>The touch button, which allows you to touch (as one of the avatars in the sim) any prim in the simulation.
A popup will appear prompting you for the prim to touch, the avatar who should do the touching, and the 
duration of the touch.</li>
</ul>
