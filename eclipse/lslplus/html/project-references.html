<h1>Project References</h1>

<p>As of LSL Plus 0.13.0, you can use the 'project references' feature of Eclipse to 
better organize your code, especially if your are using the LSL Plus modules feature.
</p>

<p>If you want to split your LSL development into multiple projects, yet share a library
of modules among all those projects, you can setup a project containing just the 
library of modules (organized into folders however you choose), and then create a 
reference from each project that uses those modules to the project containing the 
library.  To create a project reference, you use the project properties, which you
access via the project context menu:</p>

<p>There is a references section which you can access from the properties dialog:</p>

<p>
In the example, the project 'abd' has a reference to a library project, 'lib'.  When
scripts are compiled in 'abd' it will look for modules (only modules!) in both the
'lib' and 'abd' projects.  If the same module appears in both projects (e.g.
both have a module 'foo.lslm' in the folder 'bar', which means both modules
have a fully qualified name of 'bar.foo.lslm') then the one in the local project
('abd') will take preference over the one in the reference.</p>

<p>Note that references (as far as LSL Plus is concerned) are not transitive: 
if project 'A' refers to project 'B', and project 'B' refers to project 'C', 
LSL Plus will not look for modules in 'C' when compiling scripts in 'A'.  LSL
Plus will only look in 'C' for modules when compiling scripts in 'A' if 'A' 
directly depends on 'C'.</p>
