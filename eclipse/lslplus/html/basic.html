<h1>Basic Usage</h1>
<p>
To use the 
plugin, you need to create an LSL Plus project.
</p>
<p>Select File -> New -> Other...,</p>

<p>
 which will bring up the &quot;New&quot; wizard, </p>
 
<img src="images/select-project-wizard.jpg"/>

 <p>which 
prompts you to select a wizard.  Under the &quot;LSL Plus&quot; folder is the 
&quot;LSL Plus Project&quot; wizard.  Select this and click &quot;Next&quot;.  </p>

<img src="images/myproject.jpg"/>

<p>
On the next page,
enter a name for your project (e.g. &quot;myproject&quot;), and click &quot;Finish&quot;. 
Eclipse will switch into the &quot;LSL Plus Perspective&quot; which you may not notice, but
looks like this:</p>
<img src="images/lsl-plus-perspective.jpg"/>

<p>
You should have the &quot;Navigator&quot; view on your display, and it should show your
new LSL Plus project.  The project folder will be decorated with a wee &quot;L&quot;
to indicate that it is indeed an LSL Plus project.
</p>
<p>
Now you can add LSL Plus scripts and other LSL Plus files to your project.
</p>

<p>There are four basic types of files that you can create within an LSL Plus project (that 
LSL Plus knows or cares about).  These are <em>module</em> files, <em>script</em> files (discussed 
<a href="plus.html">here</a>) as 
well as <a href="unit-test.html">unit test</a> files and <a href="sim-project.html">Sim Project</a> files.  Unit 
test files allow the specification of unit tests to exercise LSL code fragments (handlers and functions).  Sim 
Project files allow you to create complex environments, with objects, avatars, and running scripts, to allow
you to test multiple scripts interacting with their environment and each other.
