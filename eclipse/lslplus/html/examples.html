<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>Examples are provided to illustrate some of the features of LSL Plus.  Currently, two samples 
are provided, both of which illustrate a 'Sim Project' in conjunction with and event handler module:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTTP/RPC Example: illustrates a script that uses HTTP request/reply and XML-RPC, along with an event
handler module to simulate XML-RPC requests.</li>
<li>Dialog Example:  illustrates a script that scans for a nearby avatar, and presents a dialog to that avatar, 
along with an event handler  module to simulate the avatar making a selection from the dialog.</li>
</ul>

<p>The examples can be installed into an LSL Plus project by selecting (from the context menu within the
Navigator view, from File -> New) the appropriate example creation wizard:</p>

<p>You select the location where you want it installed, and can then look at the source code and run 
the sample.</p>
