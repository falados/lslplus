<h1>Unit Test File</h1>
<p>The LSL Plus plugin can execute individual functions and handlers of your scripts an modules in
<em>unit tests</em>.  Unit tests are &quot;written&quot; by building a tree of tests within a test file.
First, you must create a test file, which you do in a manner similar to creating a script file -- launching
the appropriate wizard under the <em>New</em> popup menu.  Tests automatically get the extension 
<em>lslt</em> - you don't have to specify it.</p>

<p>This what the initial test file looks like (a test suite with no tests in it):</p>
<img src="images/blank-suite.jpg"/>

<p>The test editor is much different than the code editor. In essence it is a graphical XML editor, although
you never see the XML.  A test file defines a <em>suite</em> of tests.   Each test tests a single 
LSL entry point (function or handler) by specifying the full path to the entry point (path to the module or
script, plus path to the entry point within the source file.  For a function, the path to the entry point
within the source element is just the function name.  For a handler it is the state name '.' the handler name, 
e.g. default.link_message), the arguments (if any) to the entry point, the expected return value (if applicable)
or &quot;don't care&quot; if you you do not want the test to fail no matter what is returned.  You can
specify initial values of global variables (if you don't the default initialization will occur) and
the expected final values of global variables, for those you care about.<p>

<p>Adding a test - first right click and select Add Test:</p>
<img src="images/add-test.jpg"/>

<p>Then specify the entry point (using the combo boxes, which will allow you to pick any entry point in
your code base):</p>
<img src="images/entrypoint.jpg"/>

<p>This creates an initial test that looks something like:</p>

<img src="images/initial-test.jpg"/>

<p>This test will call the <em>hello</em> function in the <em>hello.lslm</em> module, and
doesn't care what it returns (the value is blank -- which is good, because 'hello' has no return value).  This test should
always pass.  Save it (Ctrl-S), and then run it:</p>
<img src="images/launch-test.jpg"/>

<p>We see that it passes, but if we drill down into the test results, we can see more of what happened:</p>

<img src="images/first-test.jpg"/>

<p>
The log shows that the function <em>llOwnerSay</em> was called with the argument &quot;hello&quot;.
</p>


<p> You can specify what LL functions
you expect to be called, with what arguments, and what these functions should return.  Note, you only specify
calls to <em>non-stateless</em> LL functions.  Stateless functions are those functions which always return
the same result for a given set of arguments (examples of these are the mathematical function, list manipulation
functions, string functions, etc.).  These <em>stateless</em> functions don't interact with the SL environment
in any way, and therefore behave as expected when called within your unit tests.  But stateful function (there
are lots of these -- prim/object manipulation functions, parcel functions, physics functions, etc.) behavior
depends on the state of the environment; therefore, for the unit tests, you can specify exactly how they should
behave within your tests by specifying what sequence of calls you expect, with what arguments, and can specify
the return value (if applicable) for each particular expected call.  There are several modes you can specify for
these <em>mock</em> calls:

<ul>
    <li><em>nice</em> mode.  No matter what call is made return a result.  If the user hasn't specified
    a result for a particular function and set of arguments, return a default value (0 for scalars,
    the empty string for strings, the null key for keys, the zero vector for vectors, the zero rotation
    for rotations, and the empty list for lists).
    <li><em>normal</em> mode.  If the user hasn't specified that a particular call, with a particular
    set of arguments will be made, the test fails.
    <li><em>exhaust</em> mode.  Like normal mode, but if all the calls that the user has specified will
    be made are not actually made during the execution of the test, the test fails.
    <li><em>strict</em> mode.  Like exhaust mode, but with the additional restriction that all the calls
    must be made in the exact order that they were specified.  Otherwise the test fails.
</ul>

<p>If we change the <em>calls mode</em> for the test we defined above to <em>normal</em> we no longer get
a successful outcome:</p>

<img src="images/second-test.jpg"/>

<p>The test fails because, since we aren't being 'nice', the call to <em>llOwnerSay</em> is unexpected, and
causes the test to fail.  We can then change our test to indicate we expect a call to llOwnerSay with
the appropriate argument.  First, use the context menu to add a call:</p>

<img src="images/add-call.jpg"/>

<p>Then select the function you expect:</p>

<img src="images/enter-expected-func.jpg"/>

<p>This adds the call to the call list, with expected arguments defaulted to &quot;don't care&quot; (the 
value field is blank).
You can then edit the argument to tell it you expect it to be &quot;hello&quot;.</p>

<img src="images/edit-argument.jpg"/>

<p>Rerunning the test with this change will cause it to once again pass.</p>

<p>Regardless of the mode, when you specify a call (<em>mock up</em> a call) you can either pass in an actual 
parameter that you expect, or specify &quot;don't care&quot (by clearing all text from the field); which will successfully match any argument.</p>

<p>When the test is run, the global variables are initialized and the code in the entry point is executed, with
calls to external (non-stateless) LL functions handled as you specify in the test.  The test may abort (fail) early
(if an unexpected LL call is made), otherwise it runs to completion, at which point the strict/exhaust tests are 
made to see if all the correct function calls were made, the return value is tested to see if it matches expectations,
and the final values of globals are tested against any expectations were set.  The results are presented in a
JUnit like format, with a progress bar advancing as the tests are run (turning to red when failures are encountered),
and the test results presented in a tree.  Part of the test results is a complete log of all LL functions that were
called (both stateless, aka internal, functions, and non-stateless/external functions).</p>

<p>The editing is done via either right clicking
to add new elements to the tree, or delete elements (such as new tests, or new calls in the list of expected calls),
or by
selecting the second column of a row and editing directly the value therein.  You can also edit the name of the
test suite and the name of each test.  You can't edit the entry point for a test (e.g. hello.lslm/hello) or
an expected call (e.g. 'llOwnerSay').  To change these you need to delete the test or call and then create a new
test or call to replace it.</p>

<p>When specifying arguments and return values, and values of global variables (either initial or expected final), you
can enter LSL expressions, e.g.:</p>
<img src="images/computed-argument.jpg"/>

<p> These expressions can contain literal values and LL predefined constants (e.g. <em>TRUE</em>)
combined with the usual operators.  You can't call functions or refer to variables.  This facility allows you to
do things such as pass in mask values by oring together the appropriate LSL constants, rather than having to 
figure out what the actual value of those constants are, oring them together yourself, and typing the resulting
value into your test.</p>

<p>The test editor now has full undo/redo support, just like the <a href="sim-project.html">Sim Project Editor</a>.</p>
