<h1>Sim Project File</h1>

<p>A Sim Project file is a file that defines the configuration of a simulated environment for LSL scripts to
run within.  The environment can contain avatars and objects, which can contain scripts and other inventory items.
Scripts, embedded in prims, can communicate with one another using chat, email, or link messages, just as in
the 'real' LSL environment.</p>

<p>
A Sim Project can be 'launched' (by right clicking on the file and selecting the correct 'run' option) in 
both 'Run' and 'Debug' modes.  When launched, the various scripts configured in the Sim Project will run and begin
handling events.  Much of the activity is captured in a log that is displayed to the user as the simulation proceeds.
If in debug mode and a breakpoint is hit, the simulation suspends, giving the user the opportunity to step through
code, inspect variables, etc.</p>

<p>The Sim Project file is edited using a custom editor, which looks like this:</p>

<img src="images/sim-project-editor.jpg"/>

<p>The project has a tree structure, with the 'world' at the top level, and the in-world avatars and rezzed
objects just under the root.  Inventory objects (such as running scripts, or notecards) are contained with in
the individual prims of the top-level objects.  Of course, prims can contain there own inventory objects, which in
turn can contain scripts and other objects etc.  Just as in SL, only scripts that are in the 'top level' (rezzed)
objects will be running.</p>

<p>When a Sim Project is running, you can observe its behavior and iteract with it via the
