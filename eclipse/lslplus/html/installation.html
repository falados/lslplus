<h1>Installation</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>
If you are reading this Help material, it is likely that you have already
installed the LSL Plus Eclipse plugin.  However, LSL Plus will not work 
properly unless the LSL Plus native executable (a.k.a. the Haskell Core)
is also installed.  If you are running on Windows, your
distribution of the plugin probably had the native executable embedded in it.  On
other platforms, you must install it separately.
<p>
Installing the native executable on Unix based platforms, such as Linux
or Mac, generally requires building the executable, unless a binary distribution
of the executable is available.  Check the SourceForge download site for binary
distributions.  If a binary distribution exists, you can drop it anywhere
on your Unix PATH, and the LslPlus plugin will be able to execute it.
<p>
If there is no binary distribution available for your platform, you can build
it from source.  Building LslPlus requires the installation of the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 6.10.1 or later, which is available from the 
<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">GHC website</a>.  You can obtain the source
distribution from the 
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html">
Hackage Repository</a>, on the 
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/LslPlus">
LslPlus page</a>.
<p>
Once you have the source distribution, which is a tarball that has been compressed with
gzip, and have extracted it to some directory,
from within that directory, execute the following command:
<pre>
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
</pre>

<p>
You will probably be told that there are some libraries on which the package depends that
are not installed.  All of these other
libraries, which aren't distributed by default with GHC, are available from the 
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html">
Hackage Repository</a>.  The following packages are known to be needed:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string">utf8-string</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/polyparse">polyparse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HaXml">HaXml</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/binary">binary</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/pureMD5">pureMD5</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Each package is installed using the following sequence of commands:
<pre>
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install
</pre>

<p>
Note: some packages may have a setup script called 'Setup.lhs' rather than 'Setup.hs'; you can check
by looking in the directory after extracting the package from the tar file.  Note also that there are
options that can be set when running the configure step, such as where to install executables.

<p>
After all dependencies are resolved, LslPlus can be installed the same way:
<pre>
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install
</pre>

<p>
The final step, 'install', will install the executable in the default location for GHC-built executables
(e.g. /usr/local/bin).  Wherever you install the executable, it must be on your PATH for the Eclipse plugin
to find it).  After you have successfully installed it, you can launch Eclipse and use all the features
of the LSL Plus plugin.
